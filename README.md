# Psychic Interactive Testing

### Overview
This app is a psychic test game. The user needs to guess what the computer is "guessing". 

## User Guide
Here's how it works:

- You have an initial form where you must type in a random letter and then hit the submit button. You have 10 guesses which count down under ```Guesses Left``` section. Your wrong guesses are also tracked.
